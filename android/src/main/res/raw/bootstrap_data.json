To the students of the institution and Chennai alike, Saarang is synonymous with culture, colour, fun, learning, and big names, big money, big dreams.</p><p>The pool of resources, great judges and opportunity it offers to young talent is a magnetic draw to students, while Chennai localites however, love Saarang for the yearly bonanza of big artistes from all over the world, performing at IIT as part of the professional and World Cultural shows. There is something for absolutely everybody, and we as we at Saarang say, this is truly the next Big Bang- see you at Saarang, for a truly out-of-the-world experience.</p>",

            "description": "<p>Saarang IIT Madras presents two of the leading lights in the field of classical dance and music. Two women who have revolutionized the performing arts with their versatility and energy will grace the Open Air Theatre this January. Be there to see Padma Shri Aruna Sairam and Padma Shri Shobana enthral you.</p><p>Padma Shri Shobana Chandrakumar is an Indian film actress and Bharata Natyam dancer. Shobana was trained under the Bharata Natyam dancers Chitra Visweswaran and Padma Subrahmanyam. She emerged as an independent performer and choreographer in her twenties. Shobana danced Abhinaya, a pivotal element in Bharata Natyam. She has worked on collaborative ventures with the likes of tabla maestro Zakir Hussain, Vikku Vinayakram and Mandolin Srinivas. Her recitals abroad include those at the World Malayalee convention, United States, in Kuala Lumpur before the King and Queen of Malaysia and numerous other places. In 2006, the Indian Government honoured Shobana with the Padma Shri for her contributions towards the classical dance. In 2014, The Kerala Government honoured her with the Kala Ratna Award.</p><p>Padma Shri Aruna Sairam is an eminent Carnatic music vocalist. In concert she continually strives to deliver a unique experience through new repertoire. Aruna has had the rare distinction of performing in such venues as the Rashtrapati Bhavan, Shakthi Sthal and Vir Bhoomi. Aruna is one of her generation's pioneering vocalists in the sense of sensitising international audiences to the sound and feel of South Indian vocal music. The BBC Proms invited her to perform at London's Royal Albert Hall as the first South Indian classical vocalist in the Proms' history. Aruna has also performed at New York's Carnegie Hall, Theatre de la Ville in Paris and Morocco's Fes Festival of World Sacred Music. The awards with which she was honoured are Padma Shri from the Government of India and the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award, Government of India in 2014. Aruna Sairam has been appointed the Advisor to the Department of Culture, Tamil Nadu, on Musical Education by the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu.</p><p>Come, witness these stalwarts of Indian Classical Arts inaugurate Saarang 2016 on the star-studded opening night. Entry is free for all.</p>",

She is set to perform at the OAT IIT Madras on January 11th 2016.</p><p>Sunidhi Chauhan is one of the most popular Indian playback singers and performers today. Her main claim to fame is her active role in the Bollywood music industry. With 1000s of studio recordings over a few years she rapidly became one of India's most recorded voices and a popular name. She has also recorded songs in several other dialects and languages, such as Punjabi, Marathi, Kannada, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Bengali and English. She has been awarded with prestigious national awards on several occasions and has established herself as the strongest live performer and singer in India to date. Sunidhi Chauhan made her International debut with the song Heartbeat, a collaboration with Enrique Iglesias. Sunidhi stepped into the world of playback singing with the 1996 Bollywood film, Shastra, lending her voice to the song 'Larki Deewaani Dekho, Ladka Deewaana.' By the age of nineteen, Sunidhi had lent her voice to over 350 songs. With blockbuster hits like 'Dance pe Chance', 'Sheila ki Jawani', 'Aaja Nachle' and 'Crazy Kiya Re' her voice has defined Bollywood music over the past decade.</p><p>Sunidhi is one of the most decorated Indian singers with 54 nominations for best playback singer. Having won the 'Best Playback Singer' award from Filmfare, International Indian Film Academy, Star Screen, GIMA and several others 20 times, she is undoubtedly the most gifted Bollywood playback singer of the present era. Legendary playback singer Lata Mangeshkar described Sunidhi as the 'numero uno' female singer of today while Shankar Mahadevan referred to her as the 'Best female singer and live performer today.'With greats such as Sonu Nigam, Vishal-Shekhar, Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy, Salim-Sulaiman having rocked the OAT at IIT Madras in the past, one expects an exciting performance at Popular Night each year. Sunidhi Chauhan is set raise the bar further this year with a plethora of songs which are bound to keep the crowd on their feet all night long.</p><p>We missed the 'first big bang', let's not miss the 'next one' at Saarang 2016!</p>",

University students are the most important part for the future of India. In all the important stages of our history, students played a vital role.
