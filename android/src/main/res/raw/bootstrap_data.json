Over the years, Saarang has remained the preferred platform of an exhibition of culture, talent and competition for students from all over India, from the fields of dance, music, literature and more, all under one roof</p><p>For four days in January, IIT Madras is transformed into a hub of activity, with a large number of students, participants, and passers-by who enjoy the amalgam of events, food stalls, workshops and music shows. To the students of the institution and Chennai alike, Saarang is synonymous with culture, colour, fun, learning, and big names, big money, big dreams.</p><p>The pool of resources, great judges and opportunity it offers to young talent is a magnetic draw to students, while Chennai localites however, love Saarang for the yearly bonanza of big artistes from all over the world, performing at IIT as part of the professional and World Cultural shows. There is something for absolutely everybody, and we as we at Saarang say, this is truly the next Big Bang- see you at Saarang, for a truly out-of-the-world experience.</p>",
