            "description": "<p>Saarang IIT Madras presents two of the leading lights in the field of classical dance and music. Two women who have revolutionized the performing arts with their versatility and energy will grace the Open Air Theatre this January. Be there to see Padma Shri Aruna Sairam and Padma Shri Shobana enthral you.</p><p>Padma Shri Shobana Chandrakumar is an Indian film actress and Bharata Natyam dancer. Shobana was trained under the Bharata Natyam dancers Chitra Visweswaran and Padma Subrahmanyam. She emerged as an independent performer and choreographer in her twenties. Shobana danced Abhinaya, a pivotal element in Bharata Natyam. She has worked on collaborative ventures with the likes of tabla maestro Zakir Hussain, Vikku Vinayakram and Mandolin Srinivas. Her recitals abroad include those at the World Malayalee convention, United States, in Kuala Lumpur before the King and Queen of Malaysia and numerous other places. In 2006, the Indian Government honoured Shobana with the Padma Shri for her contributions towards the classical dance. In 2014, The Kerala Government honoured her with the Kala Ratna Award.</p><p>Padma Shri Aruna Sairam is an eminent Carnatic music vocalist. In concert she continually strives to deliver a unique experience through new repertoire. Aruna has had the rare distinction of performing in such venues as the Rashtrapati Bhavan, Shakthi Sthal and Vir Bhoomi. Aruna is one of her generation's pioneering vocalists in the sense of sensitising international audiences to the sound and feel of South Indian vocal music. The BBC Proms invited her to perform at London's Royal Albert Hall as the first South Indian classical vocalist in the Proms' history. Aruna has also performed at New York's Carnegie Hall, Theatre de la Ville in Paris and Morocco's Fes Festival of World Sacred Music. The awards with which she was honoured are Padma Shri from the Government of India and the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award, Government of India in 2014. Aruna Sairam has been appointed the Advisor to the Department of Culture, Tamil Nadu, on Musical Education by the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu.</p><p>Come, witness these stalwarts of Indian Classical Arts inaugurate Saarang 2015 on the star-studded opening night. Entry is free for all.</p>",

With blockbuster hits like 'Dance pe Chance', 'Sheila ki Jawani', 'Aaja Nachle' and 'Crazy Kiya Re' her voice has defined Bollywood music over the past decade.</p><p>Sunidhi is one of the most decorated Indian singers with 54 nominations for best playback singer. Having won the 'Best Playback Singer' award from Filmfare, International Indian Film Academy, Star Screen, GIMA and several others 20 times, she is undoubtedly the most gifted Bollywood playback singer of the present era. Legendary playback singer Lata Mangeshkar described Sunidhi as the 'numero uno' female singer of today while Shankar Mahadevan referred to her as the 'Best female singer and live performer today.'With greats such as Sonu Nigam, Vishal-Shekhar, Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy, Salim-Sulaiman having rocked the OAT at IIT Madras in the past, one expects an exciting performance at Popular Night each year. Sunidhi Chauhan is set raise the bar further this year with a plethora of songs which are bound to keep the crowd on their feet all night long.</p><p>We missed the 'first big bang', let's not miss the 'next one' at Saarang 2015!</p>",

University students are the most important part for the future of India. In all the important stages of our history, students played a vital role. It is through this beauty of &lsquo;man-made&rsquo; art, called cinema that we&rsquo;re able to connect to each other.
